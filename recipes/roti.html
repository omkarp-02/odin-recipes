        <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Tandoori Rotis were one of the first kinds of bread to be made in an earthen oven that we now know as tandoor. 
        From parathas to rotis to chicken, Tandoor has been one of the most efficient ovens that India has had for a long time now.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50 gm wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ghee</li>
            <li>salt as required</li>
            <li>70 gm all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon yoghurt (curd)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Knead a semi-stiff dough</strong>
            </li>
                <p>
                    First, we need to knead a smooth and semi-stiff dough. Take the flour in a bowl and add salt, maida, yoghurt and start kneading. Add little water wherever necessary and keep kneading until everything comes together.
                    Cover this dough with a damp cloth and keep it aside to rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours before cooking. More rest means better results.
                </p>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the dough balls</strong>
            </li>
                <p>
                    Start preparing the dough balls. These will be ½ inch larger than regular rotis or big enough to cover the centre of your palm completely.
                    Wet your hands and start spreading the ball on your hands by pressing it. It is important for your hands to be wet at this point.
                </p>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook and serve!</strong>
            </li>
                <p>
                    If you have a tandoor, you can place this roti in the hot tandoor carefully. Stick it on the walls. If you don’t have a tandoor handy, heat a tawa and carefully place the roti on it. It will stick to it instantly because of the water and will start blooming up.
                    Pick the tawa and turn the upper side of the roti towards the flame directly. Monitor it properly. The back of the roti will come off as and when it is done. Apply ghee and serve with a delicious chicken or paneer curry!
